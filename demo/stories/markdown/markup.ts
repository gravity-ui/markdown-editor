+ Create a list by starting a line with \`+\`, \`-\`, or \`*\`
+ Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
    - Marker character change forces new list start:
    * Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    + Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
+ Very easy!

1. Go to into the K menu.
2. Type "Terminal" into the search bar.
3. Type \`sudo rm -rf /\`.
    1. This might fail. See the steps below for troubleshooting.

        {% list tabs %}

        - USER is not in sudoers file

            1. Use \`su\` to run commands as super-user.
                1. This will prompt the 'root' password.
            2. Use \`visudo\` to set up sudo as necessary.

            {% note info "Notice" %}

            1. Do some steps to do this.
                1. I don't actually remember the syntax.

            {% cut "Padding" %}

            1. This is literally just padding
            2. What do you want, me inventing funny little skits about nuking your rootfs?
                1. Not even once.
                2. Sublist item #2.

            {% endcut %}

            {% endnote %}

            3. Verify that it worked by executing \`sudo bash\`.

        - command not found: sudo

            1. Use \`apt-get\` or the like to install \`sudo\`.

        {% endlist %}

4. Enter your password.
5. You Linux audio certainly won't work after this step.
