Directory for common context-specific toolbar components that are independent of the editor.\
Context-specific in this case means that the components are dependent on some extensions\
and without them, the use and proper operation of these components is impossible.\
Accordingly, they cannot be added to the MenuBar component.

Example of components that can be found here:

- select button for headings
- select button foe text coloring
- select button for lists
- etc.
